								<br>
								<li>The proposal form for practice work, including detailed technical requirements and possible additional information. 
								Please use the following template 
							for the proposal form: <br>
							
							<strong>Ms Excel: <a href="docs/TechReqPracticeMoco2018.xlsx" target="_blank">TechReqPracticeMoco2018.xlx</a></strong>
							<br>									
							<strong>OpenOffice Format: <a href="docs/TechReqPracticeMoco2018.ods" target="_blank">TechReqPracticeMoco2018.ods</a></strong>
							<br><br>
							
							</li>
								<li>Supporting media (videos, pictures, audio, and so on), which should provide an overview of the practical work and 
								details of the practical and technical requirements for putting the work on (this is very important to ensure that we 
								can accommodate the work within the resources of our conference).<br>
								<strong>Please note that the maximum total file size allowed by the submission system is 50MB, if the supporting media exceeds 
								that size we encourage to submit a document containing links to the supporting media instead.</strong>
								</li>
							</ol>
							Please note that we are an academic conference with a low fee, which means we cannot pay for commissioned performances 
							and artworks. In addition, we cannot guarantee facilities and technical support for all possible sessions, so please give 
							us full details of your needs in the proposal form so that we can judge whether it is feasible.

						<h3>Doctoral Consortium</h3>
						<p align="justify">
						Accepted 
						papers will have an oral presentation in a dedicated session. We encourage students to submit a paper even if they are early
