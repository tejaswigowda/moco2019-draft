          <h3> Retrieving Human Traits From Gesture In Sign Language : The Example Of Gestural Identity </h3>

  ABSTRACT. Virtual signers (or signing avatars) play an important role in the accesibility of information in sign languages. They have been developed notably for their capability to anonymize the signer's appearance and to enable dynamic or interactive scenarios. Recording real movements thanks to motion capture provides human-like, realistic and comprehensible signing animations. However, such accurate systems may also convey extralinguistic information such as identity, gender or emotional state. In the present work, we want to address the problem of gestural identity in the context of animated agents in French Sign Language (LSF). On the one hand, person identification from signing motion is assessed through psychophysical experiments, using point-light displays. On the other hand, a computational framework is developed for the analysis of LSF motion in order to investigate which features are critical for identification. For some applications, determining these movement parameters will enable controlling the gestural human traits of virtual signers.

        <h3>Tracing from Sound to Movement with Mixture Density Recurrent Neural Networks </h3>

ABSTRACT. In this work, we present a method for generating 3D tracings of perceived sound features, sound-tracings, using a Mixture-Density Recurrent Neural Net (MDRNN). By training the model on a data set of single point sound-tracings and the sound features extracted from short sounds (2 to 4 seconds) the model learns to generate novel tracings using multi-modal input. This is part of an ongoing research effort to examine the complex correlations between sound and movement and the possibility of modelling these relationships using deep learning techniques.

        <h3>Towards AI-Enhanced Ballet Learning</h3>

          ABSTRACT. Since its codified genesis in the 18th century, ballet training has largely been unchanged: it relies on the word of mouth expertise passed down generation to generation and in tools that do not adequately support both dancers and teachers. Moreover, top-tier training is only found in a few locations around the world and comes at an exceptional price. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI)-based video tools might represent an affordable and non-invasive alternative: it would allow dancers and teachers to self-assess as well as enable skilled dance teachers to connect with a wider audience. In my research, I study how to design and evaluate AI-based tools to improve ballet performance for dancers and teachers.

        <h3> Adipose Tissue: Localizeable Relations and the Fat Body </h3>

				<article>
          ABSTRACT. Much of the scholarship and discourse surrounding networks, ‘making’, and liberation deal intermittently with the notion, or problem, of locality. This mirrors a broader political debate concerning the problematic between global politics and local or hyper-local notions of resistance, action, conservation, or community. Simultaneously, celebrity communist Slavoj Zizek is applauded by amphitheater crowds for his sustained faith in a central state structure, and hackers and technologists flock to decentralized network structures, ‘radical networks’, and peer-to-peer hardware . Frederick Jameson’s work on cognitive mapping quite explicitly identifies what might be a central issue; namely that we have no conception today of the relation of the local to the global, most stunningly evidenced by our relation to the planet and to its climate. My current work and practice tries to approach this problem as a philosophical one, focused on the super-locality of the fat body as a particular confluence of morbidity, dissociation, and aberrance and a useful case study for a disruption of popular understanding of bodies and transformation through a queering of extensive space and a naive proposition towards the topological localization of affect.

				<article>
          ABSTRACT. The Curious Creatures project is an exploratory Research-Creation journey. Here, the practice of Digital Media in a Virtual Reality medium is developed as an ongoing and mutable processual methodology. Sensorial engagement and embodiment practices are explored through practical exposure and conceptual immersion. Interactions of human and computer (as both agents of design and agents of use during the creation process) mirror intellectual and emotional decisions faced throughout the ongoing construction process. Parallels are drawn to existing art, conceptual frameworks, engineering practices, and technology that inspire this curiosity driven exploration.

        <h3> Eco-Somatic Performance Worldmaking </h3>

          ABSTRACT. Caring for and empowering the self is primary in creating space for healthy relationship with other. In the context of the technologically mediated other, how can one maintain solid ground in our embodied selves while creating new spaces and practices for meeting other? How can technological utilization reflect the beauty and supporting qualities that can be found in the otherness of the natural world? What practices and stories do we learn from listening to our senses, our bodies, and our imagination in relationship to otherness, both in technological extended environments and the natural world, and how can these learned practices and stories be translated and transformed between the personal, the collective, the virtual, and the real?

My practice based research is a search in the space connecting bodies to the immersive qualities and healing potential of nature, virtual reality, creative expression, and the imagination. If the criterion is a somaesthetic one, where learning, discovering, sensitizing, and honing the body's connection to seeing and shaping itself is a priority, how can immersive and interactive virtual worlds support and reflect this somaesthetic intention? What supports connection to self, in how we approach technology? What can we learn by clarifying our intention, focusing our attention, delineating clear boundaries in this relationship. If the criterion is an ecological one, how can we acknowledge the mystery and the strangeness of other? How can we experience the interconnection of living and non-living entities in curiosity and openness? How does the ecological inform the technical, and how do virtual worlds imbued with ecologocial thought, self-organizing systems, and artificial life change the somaesthetic, improvisational, creative potential in relationship to moving feeling bodies?

In this short paper, I will briefly discuss where this practice based research stems from, and what theories, practices, and related works guide its search, as well as initial performance experiments and future research directions.

        <h3> Session 2A: Installation  -- Qualia </h3>
        <h4> Lori Brungard</h4>
        <h4><a href='javascript:goto("sfb")'><span class='pin'></span> Stauffer B </a></h4>
				<article>
          ABSTRACT. Qualia is a participatory event that engages MOCO conference attendees in both subtle and overt ways, using simple technology that is readily at hand – their own phones. Qualia is a term that refers to the internal and subjective component of sense perceptions. The overall goal of this work is to forge physical, psychological, aural, and visual connections through embodied means, via a contemporary update on the postmodern task based movement score.

I propose that the work take place during the opening reception for the conference, when people register, and expect to interact with one another anyway. At registration they are invited to text the word “Affect” to an SMS short code on their phones, from which they will receive text message prompts for movement tasks throughout the evening. “Affect” can be read as both a noun and a verb. As such, it implies both an emotional state and the fact that our behavior can influence others. Initially, participants will be prompted to do simple, individual tasks, such as “Sit on the couch,” that they might do anyway, tailored to the specific environment based on consultation with the conference organizers. As they become more comfortable, they will be asked to interact: “Share your food with someone,” or “Introduce yourself with your partner’s last name.” As the participants move around the space, they make self-determined choices to comply with or ignore the prompts they receive. They listen, follow, lead, move, or recline—becoming part of the imagery of the work in ways that collude, conflict, and conjoin with one another. As the evening continues, the prompts will invite the participants to interact more actively with each other, with instructions such as “Gesticulate,” or “Mirror someone.” Some prompts are abstract, like “Reject convention”. While not physically possible, these prompts are intended to create an imaginal effect, a form of qualia.

By spontaneously interacting with the environment and one another, the participants generate their own phenomenological experiences. Thus, this work employs the concept of qualia as embodied experience to expand our understanding of one-on-one relationship to a broader cultural one. Varied interpretations of meaning in Qualia evoke questions of what is real, and how our perceptions of reality are influenced by others’ views. The intention is to both reveal these lines of difference, and also to sew them together, creating interstitial, communal bonds in a way that still acknowledges individual difference. Movement happens in the in-between, creating interstitial connections from one place and one person to another. It is the leap that must be made between two entities that creates connection. By prioritizing movement as the means of communication, the participants can foster intangible yet viscerally remembered connections as both spectators and participants.
